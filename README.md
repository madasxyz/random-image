 ## Random Image

This Node.js application serves a random image from a directory when you make a GET request to the root URL (`/`).

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/madasxyz/random-image.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

2. To start the server, run:

```
npm start
```

The server will listen on port 3000 by default.
You can change this in the index.js file.
